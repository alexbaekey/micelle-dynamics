#NOTES TO SELF

planning on viz with processing, post processing with numpy/matplotlib
timesteps correlating with time for reconstruct after exposure

implementation steps:

1. get example scripts working in processing.py
2. create phospholipid agents (should get advice from molecular microbio experts)
3. give agents self-assembly rules
4. set up radiation blast environment
5. give agents "disrupted" state, moves away from stable membrane stochastically, can spread disruption to other agents
6. time reconstruction from radiation exposure timestep to restabilization
7. plot dynamics of reconstruction time vs radius/energy of blast
